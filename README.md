### Background
Singapore might be the ultimate foodie paradise. The small island nation's population is primarily comprised of ethnic Malay, Chinese and Indian, and each of these cultures are very well represented in Singapore's food scene. The best place to enjoy the foods of these cultures is at one of Singapore's 100+ hawker centres. A hawker centre is an open-air complex that contains several stalls that serve a wide variety of affordable food and drinks. While studying abroad in Singapore, I had some of my favorite meals ever at hawker centres. Hawker culture is a big part of Singapore's culture, and of course, one of the best ways to experience a country's culture is through their food.

### About the Analysis
This project is an opportunity for me to perform some EDA on a fun, food-related topic, while getting some practice with Plotly. I find myself gravitiating towards Plotly's sharp visual toolkit these days, as I really like the interactiveness and broad scope of possibilities it offers. After cleaning the dataset, I will visually explore the data and answer questions such as:
  - Where are the hawker centres concentrated? Which areas have the most reviewed hawker centres?
  - What is the distribution of total hawker centre reviews and average ratings?
  - What is the distribution of hawker centres based on the year they were opened?
  - What % of hawker centres have markets attached? 
  - What is the trend in the type of hawker centre being opened?
